      <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Krishna Hriday ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate and dynamic learner pursuing a degree in <strong>VLSI</strong> at <strong>VIT Chennai</strong>.
        I also hold a <strong>Diploma in Computer Applications</strong>. My journey is driven by curiosity, creation, and constant learning.

      <p>
        I believe that great things happen when you combine logic with imagination â€” which is why I bridge both hardware and code.
