      <h1>ðŸŽ¯ My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy outdoor sports like <strong>football, cricket, tennis, badminton</strong>, and <strong>swimming</strong>.
        I also love indoor games like <strong>chess</strong> and <strong>carrom board</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music is a huge part of me â€” I play the <strong>flute</strong> and the <strong>piano</strong>. I also enjoy watching anime in my chill time.
        Iâ€™m not into online games â€” I like real-world challenges and analog fun.
