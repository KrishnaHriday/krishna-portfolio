      <p>
        Iâ€™m not just a learner â€” Iâ€™m an **explorer**. I dig into what fascinates me, whether itâ€™s low-level HDL code or composing music.
        I love experimenting, researching, and questioning how things work beneath the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also write â€” both creatively and technically â€” and enjoy building digital products that have meaning.
